# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Removed
- `chafa-libload` feature, has been removed from ratatui-image. Simply use halfblocks directly.

## [0.17.4] - 2025-12-25

### Fixed
- When entering search (both Link and slash), jump to the first match with the current scroll offset

## [0.17.3] - 2025-12-22

### Fixed
- Chafa linking split into three features
  - `chafa-dyn` (default) normal dynamic linking.
  - `chafa-static` statically links `libchafa.a`, which is usually not in distributions. The flake.nix builds this for the `static` output.
  - `chafa-libload` runtime libloading of chafa with halfblocks fallback. In practice, picking this means that `chafa` will most likely not be used for rendering, as it is highly unlikely that chafa would be available at runtime but not at compile-time.

## [0.17.1] - 2025-12-21

### Fixed
- Text Sizing Protocol spacing
  All tiers above #1 had letter spacing too wide.

## [0.17.0] - 2025-12-21

### Added
- Watch mode
  Use `-w` to watch the file for changes and reload.
- Print config
  Use `--print-config` to write a default config file to stdout.

### Changed
- Config defaults
  All config entries are now optional.

## [0.16.0] - 2025-12-20

### Added
- Build a static binary
- [Chafa](https://hpjansson.org/chafa/)
  Loaded at runtime, falls back to the existing primitive halfblocks implementation if not found.
- `chafa-dyn` (default) and `chafa-static` features
  Statically building and linking is tricky, so the safe choice it to just stick to `chafa-dyn` and
  then optionally provide `libchafa` on the user's system via distribution means.
  The flake.nix of the projects is an example of how to use `chafa-static`.
- `--no-cap-checks` to entirely skip querying the terminal's stdio for capabilities
  Useful only for running and testing in pseudoterminals.

### Fixed
- Handle panics gracefully (restore terminal mode)

## [0.15.0] - 2025-12-14

### Added
- Search mode

  Keycode `/` enters search mode, similar to Vim. User can enter search term and press `Enter` to
  enter "search mode", where matches are highlighted in green, and jump to first match. Pressing
  `n` and `N` navigates/jumps between matches. The current cursor position is highlighted in red.
  `Esc` clears "search mode".

### Changed
- Link search mode jumps beyond viewport

  Aligned with "search mode".

### Added
- Link navigation mode (`f` key, `n`/`N` to navigate, Enter to open)
- `enable_mouse_capture` config option

  Mouse capture is nice-to-have for scrolling with the wheel, but it blocks text from being 
  selected.
